This github repository contains two files of pseudocode, a file for a space invaders game and a file for an asteroids game.

The Space Invaders game has you play as a little ship who moves along the bottom of the screen and must shoot incoming enemy ships. If the enemies touch the ground then the player loses a life.

The Asteroids game has the player ship in the middle of the screen and you must shoot asteroids aimed at the player, the asteroids come in from the edges of the screen and break apart if you shoot them.
================================================

The pseudocode will not actually run but it outlines the variables, classes, functions that should at the least be present in your code if you were referencing the pseudocode.
The psuedocode also contains steps for inplementing the game and serves as a rough blueprint if you were to try and make these games.
