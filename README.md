This github repository contains two files of pseudocode, a file for a space invaders game and a file for an asteroids game.

The pseudocode will not actually run but it outlines the variables, classes, functions that should at the least be present in your code if you were referencing the pseudocode.
The psuedocode also contains steps for inplementing the game and serves as a rough blueprint if you were to ttry and make these game.
