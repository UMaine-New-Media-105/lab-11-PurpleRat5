Pseudocode for a simple space invaders game, pseudocode is not meant to be treated as actual code however
this will provide a framework for building the game.


Need classes for:
Ship
Bullet
Enemy

global vars:
player
enemy
enemyList
bullet
bulletList
bullettimeOut
enemyTimeOut

  -In the draw function, we need to update and draw our player.
  
  -We also need to add deltatime to our enemytimeout so that our enemies only spawn every 2 seconds
if timeout > 2000 then make a new enemy and add it to enemy list, start updating it. also set timeout back to zero

  -every frame we also need to check if space is held using keyPressed, and if it is spawn a new bullet with y speed and shoot it upwards.
increment bullettimeout by deltatime so we cant spawn a bullet every frame. 

  -every frame we also need to check bullet and enemy collision with dist.



Ship Class:
  vars:
    this.x
    this.xSpeed

  CharacterMove function:
    this function takes no inputs and is called every frame. It needs to take the user keyboard LEFT and RIGHT to move this.x by XSpeed.
    get keys using keyCode under a keyIsPressed() function
   
   CharacterShow func:
    simply draws sprite
    
 Bullet Class:
   vars this.x
   this.y
   this.ySpeed
   
   bulletMove func:
    move bullet up by ySpeed every frame in update
    
   bulletShow func:
    show bullet sprite
    
   bulletTestHit func:
    tests if bullet x and y dist is hitting enemy x and y, if so we want to call a destroy enemy func
    
  Enemy Class:
    vars this.y
    this.x
    this.Yspeed
    
   enemyMove func:
    move y by Yspeed each frame
    
   enemyShow func:
    show sprite
    
    enemyHit func:
      called if bullet touching enemy, if so destroy this enemy from an enemy list and stop updating it
